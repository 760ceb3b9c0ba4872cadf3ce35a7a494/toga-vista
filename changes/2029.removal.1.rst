A Canvas is no longer implicitly a context object. The ``Canvas.context`` property now returns the root context of the canvas. If you were previously using ``Canvas.context()`` to generate an empty context, it should be replaced with ``Canvas.Context()``. Any operations to ``remove()`` drawing objects from the canvas or ``clear()`` the canvas of drawing objects should be made on ``Canvas.context``. If you see "shadow" artefacts of previous draw operations on your canvas, it's likely because you're invoking ``Canvas.clear()``, not ``Canvas.context.clear()``.
