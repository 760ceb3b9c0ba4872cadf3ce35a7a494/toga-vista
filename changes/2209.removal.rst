The API for Documents and Document-based apps has been significantly modified. Unfortunately, these changes are not backwards compatible; any existing Document-based app will require modification.

The ``DocumentApp`` base class is no longer required. Apps can subclass ``App`` directly, passing the document types as a ``list`` of ``Document`` classes, rather than a mapping of extension to document type.

The API for ``Document`` subclasses has also changed:

* A path is no longer provided as an argument to the Document constructor;

* The ``document_type`` is now specified as a class property; and

* Extensions are now defined as a class property of the ``Document``; and

* The ``can_close()`` handler is no longer honored. Documents now track if they are modified, and have a default ``on_close`` handler that uses the modification status of a document to control whether a document can close. Invoking ``touch()`` on document will mark a document as modified. This modification flag is cleared by saving the document.
