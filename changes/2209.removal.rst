The API for Documents and Document-based apps has been significantly modified. Unfortunately, these changes are not backwards compatible; any existing Document-based app will require modification.

The ``DocumentApp`` base class is no longer required. Apps can subclass ``App``, providing the same arguments as before.

The API for ``Document`` subclasses has also changed:

* A path is no longer provided as an argument to the Document constructor;

* The ``document_type`` is now specified as a class property; and

* The ``can_close()`` handler is no longer honored. It should be converted into a normal ``on_close`` handler and explicitly installed on the document's ``main_window``.
